3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
**Following the course**

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
**Only demonstrate Question 1**
